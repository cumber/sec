Semantic Editor Combinators
===========================

Semantic Editor Combinators as described by Conal Elliott
(See: <http://conal.net/blog/posts/semantic-editor-combinators/>)
and Template Haskell support for automatically creating semantic 
editors from Algebraic Data Types

In Essence every function of the form '(a -> b) -> a -> b' is an semantic editor.
